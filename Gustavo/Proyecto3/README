To run the program: python music_rec.py

this music recommender takes some music genders and 5 songs, then it gives
you 5 songs we think tou may like.

TODO: make a load function while the program sorts the songs.
      ask for how many songs the user wants.
      modify the comboboxes, so we can have song-artist, bc we don't know
        the artist.
